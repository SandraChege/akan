### DESCRIPTION
There are many ways of naming children in the world. Some children are named after grandparents, saints, mystical meanings, favourite singer or 
even depending on the weather during the child's birth. The Akan are no different. The people of Akan name their chilldren after seven days. The 
children are named depending on the day they were born and their gender. The akan people have defined seven names per gender, each referring to a 
day of the week. For example a girl born on Monday will be called Adwoa while a boy is called Kwadwo.
